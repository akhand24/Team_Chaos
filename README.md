MISSION:

To develop a fully-functional automated library system in order to simplify the task of issuing and returning the books by the student in any institution.


SELF IMPLEMENTATION:

We have implemented the code for retreving the rfid tag-id of the student, once detected by the rfid reader and implemented a front-end user-interface for giving various options to the student like issuing or returning a book.

For this purpose, Python programming language has been used.

Once the RFID tag-id is interfaced, it is searched for in the database, in order to acquire, the details of the student.



REQUIREMENTS:

For this purpose the software requirements are the "Python-IDLE" and MySQL Database.
